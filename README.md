# R_for_biosci_data
Repository of user-friendly R scripts for bioscience data analysis. My goal here is to:

1. Provide annotated R scripts to allow for a more user-friendly experience to those transitioning from no-code data analysis softwares.

2. Develop general step-by-step protocols for the analysis of scientific data.

3. Generate structured R markdown files to facilitate reporting of data analysis.

IMPORTANT: some files may contain text in Portuguese (Brazil), I'm currently in the process of translating everything.
